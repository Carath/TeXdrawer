# Unrecognized samples

This directory contains JSON files saving unrecognized samples by a service, up to the *top_k* prediction. Typically, one may want to visualize those samples with the Frontend, to check if they are noisy or badly labelled. The files saved here should not be indexed by git, for they can weight several megabytes.
