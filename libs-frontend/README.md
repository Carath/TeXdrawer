# Frontend additional resources

This directory contains resources like javascript or css libraries used by the frontend, yet not shipped with it. Indeed, it may be desirable to fetch those files via a CDN to improve on load times. They are still saved here though, to allow the frontend to work offline (when opening the index.html file with a web browser).
