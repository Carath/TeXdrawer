## TODO

- (?) Add a metadata about the maximum 'size' of a symbol to the json output (max number of strokes / max stroke size / max samplesNumber).
- obtain the datasets used by the tested services
- obtain frequencies of each symbol, in each dataset
- create custom classes based on groups of symbols
- get request for all supported symbols/classes
- backend: type annotations? => typing + {Mypy vs Pytype vs Pyre}
- allow to draw symbols from LaTeX packages with MathJax
- compare MathJax with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
- compare Flask with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- add GET requests for hwrt and detexify lists of symbols (and print them?)
- complete test datasets with new samples
