## TODO

- Make sure the tested service do not require a specific canvas size (e.g hwrt: width=400, height=400).
- (?) Add a metadata about the maximum 'size' of a symbol to the json output (max number of strokes / max stroke size / max samplesNumber).
- add an id for each symbol in a dataset
- normalize detexify probabilities
- standardize the guess object in the formatter
- list all used symbols for each services
- obtain the datasets used by the tested services
- obtain frequencies of each symbol, in each dataset
- create custom classes based on groups of symbols
- allow to draw symbols from LaTeX packages with MathJax
- add a MathJax logo?
