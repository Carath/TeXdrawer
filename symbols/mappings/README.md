## Mappings

Files in this directory contain symbol mappings. They are used to create equivalence classes between identical or very similar symbols, in order to help the classifiers.

Careful: symbols listed in those files are not tied to a particular service, and can be absent from them.

Discarded symbols by hwrt:
- most upper case symbols from greek alphabet
- ???
