# TeXdrawer

The goal of this small frontend is to help building balanced datasets of handwritten LaTeX symbols.


## Install


## Usage


## TODO

- Add a metadata about the maximum 'size' of a symbol to the json output (max number of strokes / max stroke size / max samplesNumber).
- Format compatibility with detexify/hwrt?
- Hardcode canvas size for compatibility? (hwrt: width=400, height=400)
- Process received data from detexify/hwrt.
- Enable to save new datasets on the backend?
