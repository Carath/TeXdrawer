# TeXdrawer

The goal of this small frontend is to help building balanced datasets of handwritten LaTeX symbols.


## TODO

- Add a metadata about the maximum 'size' of a symbol to the json output (max number of strokes / max stroke size / max samplesNumber).
- Format compatibility with detexify/hwrt ?
